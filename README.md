# 2D physics fan

- simple 2d rigid body physics demos
- i developed it for learning purposes
- click and drag any of bodies
- you can also rotate body by hovering mouse at center and "wheel" it
- distance, collision, friction constraints
- special csr matrices for optimization


## @todo:
- [ ] gjk-epa contacts
- [ ] capsule shape
- [ ] involve joints
- [ ] joint islands
- [ ] sleeping
- [ ] mouse joint
- [ ] physics materials
- [ ] collision masks (layers)
- [ ] basic shape tests, like ray casting, test box, etc.
- [ ] fix interpenetration
- [ ] more demos
