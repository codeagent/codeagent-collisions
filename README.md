# 2D physics fan

- simple 2d rigid body physics demos
- i developed it for learning purposes
- click and drag any of bodies
- you can also rotate body by hovering mouse at center and "wheel" it
- distance, collision, friction constraints
- special csr matrices for optimization


## @todo:
- [ ] gjk-epa contacts
- [ ] capsule shape
- [ ] motors
- [ ] slide constrains
- [ ] fix interpenetration
- [ ] more demos
